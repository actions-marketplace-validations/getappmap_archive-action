name: Build and save an AppMap archive
description: |
  Build an AppMap archive from a test run. In non-matrix builds, this action should be run
  run when code is merged to the main branch. The archive is saved to the GitHub artifact store.
  In matrix builds, this action should be run for each matrix job. The archive is saved to 
  the action cached, and then in a subsequent job, the archives are merged into a single archive
  using the `merge` action.
inputs:
  directory:
    description: Command working directory.
  archive-id:
    description: |
      0-based numerical id of a matrix job. This id is used to store the AppMap archive in the action cache.
      Once the matrix jobs complete, the `merge` action can be used to merge the archives into a single archive,
      and then save it as an artifact. If `archive-id` is set, the archive is saved to the cache. Otherwise,
      it's uploaded to the artifact store. For a non-matrix job, `archive-id` should not be used.
  revision:
    description: |
      Revision (commit SHA) to name the AppMap archive with. The default is the GITHUB_SHA.
      Under normal circumstances, the default value is correct and this input does not need to be specified.
  thread-count:
    description:
      Number of worker threads to use for processing the archive. Defaults to the number of CPUs /
      cores, as reported by Node.js. If the worker machine has a high number of CPUs/cores, the
      archive action may become I/O-bound rather than CPU-bound, and better performance might be
      obtained by setting this value to a lower number.
